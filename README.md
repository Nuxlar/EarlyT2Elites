# Early T2 Elites

Allows all Tier 2 Elites (included modded) to spawn pre-loop. Fully configurable. Default values have reduced HP and Damage multipliers as well as a lower cost. The default starting stage is 4.

If you'd like reworked Tier 2 elites as well, use [EliteReworks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/EliteReworks/) instead. DO NOT USE BOTH.
